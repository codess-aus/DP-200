# DP-200 Implementing an Azure Data Solution

**Cosmos DB** is a non-relational data store that allows you to query data by using one of five APIs. The Table API allows you to use OData and Language Integrated Query (LINQ) to query data. You can issue LINQ queries with .NET. The Table API is best used to migrate applications using Table Storage without needing to update the code. You should consider using the Core (SQL) API for a new application using Cosmos DB.
